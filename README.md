# MalX: Advanced Security Tool

MalX is a Python-based security tool designed to help users monitor their systems for potential threats, including malware, unusual network activity, and unauthorized changes. With an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), MalX aims to provide essential security checks to enhance your digital safety.

## Features

- **Malware Detection**: Scans for known signatures of malware and spyware.
- **Network Monitoring**: Detects unusual network activity, such as unknown IPs and suspicious connections.
- **Process Monitoring**: Identifies suspicious processes that might indicate malware presence.
- **File Integrity Monitoring**: Detects unauthorized changes to critical files.
- **Registry Monitoring**: Monitors the Windows registry for suspicious changes (Windows only).
- **Port Scanning**: Detects open ports that shouldn't be open, indicating potential backdoors or remote access tools (RATs).
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Monitors for suspicious behavior, such as keylogging or abnormal CPU usage.
- **User Alerts**: Notifies users when suspicious activity is detected.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python libraries (install via pip):

```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Setup Instructions

To set up the MalX project in a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malx.git
   cd malx
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   - For Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment** (if not already activated).
2. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- Click on the buttons in the GUI to initiate various scans and monitoring tasks.
- Check the log area for updates on scan progress and results.
- Notifications will inform you of completed scans and any suspicious activity detected.
